        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        Hello! I am a passionate and dedicated college student pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I am currently enrolled at British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT).
        I am intrested in Networking, Cybersecurity and DevOps. In my first 2 years at BCIT I was in a program called Computer Information Technology (CIT). In this program 
        In this program I learned many use skills like web development, networking, CI/CD pipelines, and programming.
        <br>
        During my first 2 years I excelled in my networking, DevOps and databases courses which I had a great intrest in. These skills helped me in the projects I did for the City of Vancouver
        and TeraDrive.
        <br>
        I am excited to enter the IT industry and gain even more experince and knowledge and expand my skillset.
